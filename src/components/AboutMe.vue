						So, as mentioned in my intro, I am a Software Engineer. I completed my BEng in
						Software Engineering @ Sheffield Hallam University last May. Very happy to say I gained
						1st Class grades for this &#x1f60e;. Since then I have been working as a Junior
						Developer @ Rullion. I'm always looking to improve mine and my team's way of working
						and I strive to always learn new tech in a fast-paced industry. Outside of work I tend
						to dabble here and there; updating <i>my-knowledge</i> repo, continuing projects or
						starting new ones, or learning about new tech that I simply have not discovered yet.
						So that's me in a nutshell, you can read on if you want...

						Syntactically, I am currently working in the JavaScript world. This is a constantly
						moving area of software development with new frameworks/libraries popping up
						constantly claiming they are the latest and greatest bit of kit. It is fun to keep
						up with the JS world as it is a challenge within itself. I work in JS in both
						professional and personal projects. So a bit of overview on tech used:
					</p>
				</b-col>
			</b-row>
			<b-row>
				<b-col cols="12">
					<ul>
						<li>
							With regards to JS libraries/frameworks used:
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>Node.js</b> for many server-side projects in; professional, personal, &
									academic life
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Vue.js</b>. Personal projects only and you're looking at 1 of them... This
									site is written using this framework
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>React</b>, again, personal projects. Mainly used to jump on the bandwagon and
									to experiment with SSR and webpack
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Express</b> to build a well written API which I am quite partial to &#x1f648;.
									Used in; professional, personal, & academic. Used here actually to talk to
									3rd party services
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>AngularJS</b> & <b>Angular</b>. Probably less impressive than it was a couple
									years ago. Nevertheless, did a few academic projects using the MEAN stack. Also
									used <i>Ionic</i> and <i>Cordova</i> on top of it
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Mocha</b>. Because saying that you have done unit testing is important. I try
									to be <i>(as much as I can)</i> an implementer of TDD
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Aside from JS specifically, I touched on a lot of other tech throughout my Bachelors
							degree and just general learning <i>(some of which is still relevant)</i>:
							<ul>
								<li>
									As with most developers who work with JS <i>(unless only done server-side)</i>,
									I have <i>HTML5</i> knowledge along with different styling methods such as;
									<i>CSS</i>, <i>LESS</i>, <i>SCSS/SASS</i>
								</li>
								<li>
									Database creation and maintenance using <i>SQL</i> and <i>NoSQL</i>.
									Specifically MySQL and MongoDB but the underlying language is what matters
								</li>
								<li>
									On my industrial placement as part of my degree, I maintained a RESTful API
									written in <i>Spring</i>
								</li>
								<li>
									Toyed with various task runners <i>(i.e. Gulp/Grunt)</i>
								</li>
								<li>
									Managed project dependencies using <i>NPM</i> and <i>Maven</i>
								</li>
								<li>
									More unit testing with <i>JUnit</i>
								</li>
								<li>
									File bundling with <i>Webpack</i>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

				Work

			<h6>
				<b>Junior Developer <i>(F/T)</i> | Rullion Ltd., Altrincham, UK</b>
			</h6>
			<small><i>August 2017 - (ongoing)</i></small>
			<p>
				Rullion is a specialised recruitment agency working within:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Engineering</li>
				<li>IT</li>
				<li>Nuclear</li>
				<li>Rail</li>
				<li>Construction</li>
				<li>Commerce</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				There ultimate goal is to become the most <b>respected</b> recruitment agency in the UK.
				Note that I used the term 'respected' over 'wealthiest' or 'largest'. This is because one
				of the company's values is they believe that true success in business is measured in more
				than just profit and that people are priceless. I just thing those are really good values to
				run a business on and thought they were worth mentioning.
			</p>
			<p>
				My day to day @ Rullion is maintaining our main product which is
				an in-house developed ATS <i>(Applicant Tracking System)</i>. A lot of this maintenance
				is bug fixing or specialised enhancements for some of our clients. The ATS is written in ES5
				JS but we are currently innovating the next major release in Node.js
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently we are also working at enhancing our deployment through utilising; <i>Ansible</i>,
				<i>Docker</i>, & <i>Kubernetes</i> AND improve our robustness <i>(is that a word?</i> using
				GitLab CI and CD
			</p>
			<p>
				We are currently working to become more Agile. We have a daily standup but we recognise that
				we need to be better and we are currently working on getting fortnightly sprints off the
				ground.

				<b>Junior Software Developer <i>(F/T)</i> | BOSCH Automotive Service Solutions Ltd.,
				Stockport, UK</b>
			</h6>
			<small><i>September 2015 - September 2016</i></small>
			<p>
				Everyone knows of BOSCH, yeah? Okay well this division focused on the automotive
				industry... as the name suggests. I use my car just to get me from A to B but ever think
				what's inside it? Yeah, computers. Most of the computers within a standard automotive
				vehicle are manufactured by, you guessed it, BOSCH automotive. Woooo! I am very grateful
				to this division for accepting me for my industrial placement. I learned copious amounts
				related on how to be a good software developer. So, thank you!
			</p>
			<p>
				My day to day @ BOSCH was creating an SQI dashboard for product owners. I was only a
				dev in training <i>(hence the term 'Junior')</i> so was not as knowledgeable of how the
				software world works as I am now. For this reason, it took a while to get this project
				off of the ground. Apart from this main dev project, I did work on other cool stuff as well:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Redesigning our main product to meet client specs
				</li>
				<li>
					Development of Vehicle Communication Protocols & Management
				</li>
				<li>
					CI Development including automated testing using mocks/stubs and simulated envs
				</li>
				<li>
					Developed an IoT device representing Vehicle data for an AR display
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Looking at that list now and it actually sounds pretty cool &#x1f60d; Lots of buzz words
				in there.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				Education & Qualifications
			</h4>
			<p>
				I started programming back in 2012 when I was in college. When selecting my courses, I had
				to choose 4 subjects I wanted to do. 3 of them I got nailed down pretty quickly but was very
				unsure on the 4th. There was a new course that had been introduced into the curriculum that
				year called 'Computing'. I had no idea what it was but I liked computers so I thought
				"meh, I'll give that a go". It was learning basic programming principle as well as coding
				simple applications in Visual Basic. But that is where it all began for me... <i>(oh and I
				secured a grade B at A-Level in this which was a 2 year course)</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				From college, I loved the Computing course so much that I had a look around at university
				courses and Software Engineering caught my eye. Nothing to do with the fact my architecture
				ambissions had already been crushed So this was a 4 year course at
				Sheffield Hallam University. I completed the course in May 2017 and was happy to receive
				1st Class grades.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have found that I really thrive in academia and that is why I have chosen to undertake an
				MSc in Advanced Computer Science @ Manchester University stating September 2018. I have
				chosen to undertake this part time whilst working for Rullion. The choice was because I will
				get exposure to academia as well as still gaining industry experience. It will be a hard
				slog taking up 2.5 years but I am sure it will be worth it
